## Using the REST API

You can also access the REST API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is `localhost:3000/api/`, so you can e.g. reach the API with [`localhost:3000/api/feed`](http://localhost:3000/api/feed)).

### `GET`

- `/api/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/api/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

### `POST`

- `/api/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/api/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

### `PUT`

- `/api/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

### `DELETE`

- `/api/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`
